	<p>Krispy is a place where most people go to. Most of the people who has taken my survey has never been to Dunkin Donuts. The reason for that is because there are more Krispy Kreme places than Dunkin Donuts. Krispy Kreme are also more know than Dunkin Donuts around in L.A or California in general. Also, people loves Krispy Kreme more than Dunkin' because that is just their favorite place. In my survey I asked which donut place was their favorite and most people chose Krispy Kreme over Dunkin'.</p>
